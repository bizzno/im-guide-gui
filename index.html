Bofa Rush Ironman v1.4 by Kirbuti (last update: 28 July 2023)


Section 0: Setup/General notes

This guide is designed to prioritize:
	1. Rushing 43 Prayer while as low of a combat level as possible,
	2. Obtaining barrows gloves, 
	3. Completing Song of the Elves immediately afterwards,
	4. Begin completing Corrupted Gauntlet with stats that are reasonable to do so
This is not necessarily the fastest or most efficient way to achieve these milestones.

Many thanks to Oziris, B0aty, Alfie, and others for development of prior ironman guides.

Section 2: Tempoross, Wintertodt, 43 Prayer, Combat Quests

2A. Tempoross

Go to Tempoross until 65 Fishing. Raise kittens in the process.
	Soloing will not get you any Construction XP but will get more rewards
	Massing is less rewards but easier and gets Construction XP
	Refer to UIM Colossi's Low level solo guide: https://youtu.be/WzWGjWmUDwI
This should get the following rewards:
	About 300k in casket loot, including rune items, gems, jewelry, gold bars, and gp
		Rune items will be alched after lava dragons grind
	350 normal planks, 250 oak planks, 3500 steel nails
	250 raw swordfish, 500 raw bass, 750 raw lobster, 1400 raw tuna, 200 raw pike
	5500 spirit flakes
	8000 fishing bait, 8000 feathers
	At least one of tackle box/fish barrel/tome of water
	About 45-48 Cooking
	Some Construction levels if you did masses

During Tempoross grind:
	Buy 1000 feathers (or 10 packs) and 1 inventory of bronze bars (there is a Shantay shop at Tempoross)
	Complete Observatory Quest (3 planks, molten glass, bronze bar, food)
		Recommend doing this while handing in a cat
		Recommend grabbing some antipoisons from the spawn nearby

After Tempoross grind, boat back to Al-Kharid
If you did not get any sapphire necklaces from Tempoross caskets, craft up to 10 of them
	If you also did not get any gold bars, don't craft any at this time and skip going to Mage Bank for now
	If you need to get 22 Crafting to make necklaces:
		Turn in Dwarf Cannon for Crafting XP (bring Nulodion's Notes & Ammo mould)
		Cut any uncut sapphires you have
		Craft tiaras from any silver bars from caskets
		Do NOT cut opals/jades/red topazes yet as you will break a lot of them

Minigame tele to Soul Wars, grab knife from bank, leave to Edgeville
Take lever to Wildy, go to Mage Bank 
	HCIM risk but recommend doing this anyways and hovering logout button
		VERY unlikely you will run into anyone who is trying to pk low level accounts
	If you absolutely refuse to go to Mage Bank you can take the alternative path listed below
		This is nearly as risky as going to Mage Bank anyways- involves completing The Feud at ~10 hp
Buy 20 cosmic runes
Enchant sapphire necklaces into games necklaces

Cook some of the raw fish you got from Tempoross rewards. This is your food supply for Wintertodt
	Best place to cook is Rogues Den, don't need to cook all at this time

<<<Only do this if you are a HCIM and do not want to go to Mage Bank, otherwise skip to Section 2B>>>

		Teak south of Castle Wars (1 tree) or Northern coast of Isle of Souls (3 trees)
		(Optional) Keep extra teak logs for future tick manipulation skilling

Go to Wintertodt until 60 Woodcutting, saving all crates. Raise kittens in the process
	This will likely also get at least 90 Firemaking. You can stay until 99 if you want
	Fletch as little or as much as you want. Fletching will slow down wc xp gained
	If you solo, this will get extra Construction XP
	<add solo guide>
	Open the crates at 60 woodcutting, using full inv trick to get extra rolls from each crate
	If you do not get 13 magic logs, keep going until you do (at this point open each crate individually)
	If you did not get any games necklaces earlier, don't worry about turning in cats
	[Diary] Kourend/Kebos Medium: Subdue the Wintertodt

Complete Witch's House 
	Getting this done before lava dragons makes them a bit safer without gaining too many combat levels

	Safespotting example: https://youtu.be/bDB351j-qZI?t=178
	
Use supplies from Temp/Todt to get 27 Crafting, craft a sapphire amulet and enchant into Amulet of Magic

2C. Lava Dragons & Wilderness tasks

Option 1: Kill lava dragons as instructed below
	Buy 7500 casts of fire strike (82500 gp), kill lava dragons for bones.
		Starting at 13 Magic, using all of these casts gets about 53 Magic
		Buy extra casts as needed. Each kill should be ~75-100 casts. With tome it's ~50-75 casts each
	Without looting bag, only try for 10 kills per trip. With bag go for 15-20
	Prioritize other loot to put in looting bag, keep bones in inventory
		If you are attacked at Lava Dragon Isle, bury the bones in your inventory
	Each bone is effectively 595 prayer xp at Chaos altar or 340 XP buried on Lava Dragon Isle.
	If you get 40 Prayer, completing Recruitment Drive, Priest in Peril, and Holy Grail will get you 43
		40 Prayer takes 61 bones at Chaos altar
		43 Prayer takes 85 bones at Chaos altar
	If you get these drops, keep at least one: Rune axe, rune kiteshield, rune full helm, lava battlestaff
		Alch the rest after 52+ Magic

	First quest that "needs" overheads for the typical player is Monkey Madness I (much later in the guide)

	(Optional) Get Master wand too
	Refer to GotR section for runes needed

Go to Wizard's Guild and buy mystic top, bottom, and hat

Get 80 Magic, complete Mage Arena I and II (HCIMs can just do the first one)
	I recommend bursting jellies in Catacombs, otherwise MM1 dungeon is fine

Complete Song of the Elves (full steel set, red/purple dye, mourner gear, gas mask, silk, runite bar,
	8 limestone bricks, tbox, rope, nature rune, flowers or irit, adamant chainbody, wine of zamorak,
	cabbage, black knife/dagger, cadantine seed, seed dibber, vial of water, p&m, hammer, saw,
	pickaxe, axe, spade, best obtainable magic gear, nightshades, blood blitz runes)
	Use blood blitz on Fragment on Seren. Should not need brews. Nightshade method guarantees this

Obtain a Bow of Faerdhinen and full Crystal armour from Corrupted Gauntlet
	If struggling to get completions, recommended to train Ranged by:
		1. Hunting red chins north of Prifddinas and train with those 
			Unlock MM2 tunnels for this
		2. AFKing ammonite crabs on Fossil Island with iron/steel knives/darts or bone cbow
	Going on rate for 1 enhanced seed (400 kc) gives a lot of supplies/gp which will help get 82 smith/craft 
		These are boostable reqs
	If you get a 2nd enhanced weapon seed before 6 armour seeds, highly recommended to make blade too
	Yes, you need to get the Crystal helm. There are plenty of places to use Bofa off slayer tasks

This is the end of the main guide


Topics not covered:


Hunting Implings
	Rushing Hunter can bypass other item reqs e.g. magic logs, glory but isn't very reliable
	Hunting eclectics is the best way to get medium clues though

Obtaining Xeric's talisman
	Option 1: Complete Kourend/Kebos Easy Diary, kill lizardmen for Shayzien favour
	Option 2: After unlocking Fairy Rings, thieve chests in Lizardman Lair
	Not included in this guide since most of Zeah is sparsely visited

Obtaining Arclight
	Train slayer in Zeah Catacombs where applicable and add 3 ancient shards to Darklight

Lovakengj, Piscarilius, and Shayzien favour
	Lovakengj: Make juniper charcoal to get 65% favour (overnight), Forsaken Tower, minecart scrolls
	Piscarilus: Hunt sandworms
	Shayzien: Heal soldiers to 5%, kill lizardmen until Xeric's talisman, tackle organized crime to 86%,
	  	obtain Shayzien Armour 5 to get 100%

Kingdom of Miscellania
	Prereq quests are easy, fund this with gp obtained from Gauntlet. Not needed prior imo
	If you have gp to spare after blackjacking feel free to throw some in

Barbarian Fishing
	Helps with early Agility & Strength XP but not necessary. I prefer Tempoross and its rewards

83 Construction + semi-max POH
	Mahogany Homes via teaks obtained from Kingdom

93 Crafting for Zenytes
	Buy a lot of buckets, mine a lot of sand, farm a lot of seaweed, superglass make

92 Mining for Amethyst
	Mine as much sand as you'll need for 93 Crafting first, then pick your favorite option below:
		1. Motherlode Mine (semi-afk, very easy, Falador Hard Diary req)
		2. Blast Mine (click intensive but great way to get runite ore. Use dynamite from CoX/diary reward)
		3. Volcanic Mine (semi-click intensive, very fast XP once you get solo method down, chance of d pick)
		4. Powermining granite in Quarry or iron in Mining Guild (fastest but yields no ores)
	Don't forget you also need 90 Fletching to make amethyst darts. Buy broad arrows for this

Dwarf quest line
	Only worth doing if you want quest cape. Just start The Giant Dwarf for Keldagrim
	Farming XP from Forgettable Tale not worth the effort since release of The Garden of Death

Myreque quest line
	Morytania has a lot of great self-contained content, such as Sepulchre and ToB
	There isn't anything locked behind these quests that is beneficial for rushing SotE
	
Rag & Bone Man I and II
	Only worth doing if you want quest cape
	Can wait until high level and having more teleports to get this out of the way quickly

Tears of Guthix
	Helps train low level stats but not required for other quests

King's Ransom
	Not needed until after 70 Prayer. By then it shouldn't be an issue to complete Knight Waves

A Kingdom Divided
	Unlock this once you can kill bosses where it is appropriate to use thralls (e.g. Zulrah)

Dragon Slayer II
	Rushing this is a great way to get 70 Prayer via Myth's Guild green dragons

Monkey Madness II
	Getting bofa first makes this a piece of cake and demonic gorillas will be much easier to kill
	Could start the quest to unlock tunnels to train Magic and Ranged

Desert Treasure II & bosses
	Quest itself: Challenging compared to others, may make quest cape diary req harder
	Vardorvis: Use fang
	Leviathan: Use bofa
	Duke: Use arclight and/or fang
	Whisperer: Use trident or better

Lunar questline & spellbook
	Incredibly useful to have but not technically required for rushing SotE.
	After Dream Mentor, unlock imbues at NMZ
	Don't make glass without Superglass make

Obtaining a Dragon pickaxe
	As of February 2023, I would recommend killing KQ while trying for KQ head for Desert Hard Diary
		Even after KQ head this is among the fastest ways to obtain one, especially with partisan
	If you don't get d pick from KQ prior to head, move to one of the three solo-scale Wildy bosses
	For HCIMs, Volcanic Mine is the "safest" way but not very fast, plus it would cost 2.5m gp to repair it
	Prior to 92 Mining it's not super important to have a d pick, but it is a significant upgrade over rune

Barrows
	Not worth it imo, runes come from GotR and armour has substitutes
	Only do this if you have POH portal and Morytania Hard diary

Killing Zulrah
	Recommended to get bofa + armour first. Thralls help too
	Otherwise use blood blitz for diary kill

Killing lizardman shamans
	Bofa with Shayzien armour works, blowpipe would be faster though, even with adamant darts

PvM Progresion after Gauntlet, Zulrah, DWH, and Trident
	Get useful drops from Slayer creatures & bosses asap and prioritize:
		1. Get Dex from CoX (solo recommended), unlock rigour
		2. Get all uniques from Graardor
		3. Get Zamorakian spear from Kril, convert to hasta
		4. Get Osmumten's fang from ToA (solo recommended)
		5. Get Avernic defender from ToB
		6a. Get Ancestral robes from CoX
		6b. Get Tumeken's shadow from ToA
		6c. Get Twisted bow from CoX
		7. Get everything else from GWD including Nex
	That's just my idea, no perfect order for this
